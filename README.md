Crossover Test

This project was made with `React`, using `node.js` with `webpack`.

The unit tests are made using `jest`.

I also created a `SQLite` database to expose the data consumed by the application b a `REST` route.

## Installing the application

Unzip the code.
run `npm install` to download the packages.
run `npm run devbuild` to build the bundle.

## Running the application

run `npm start`

## Running the tests

run `jest`
